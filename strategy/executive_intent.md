## Project Role
This project is intentionally framed as work a Director of Data Science & Analytics
would lead. This is not an individual contributor exercise.

The emphasis is on:
- Identifying marketing opportunities proactively
- Quantifying tradeoffs between growth and risk
- Delivering clear, actionable recommendations for executives
