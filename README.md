# Insurance Marketing Analytics Decision Engine

## Executive Summary
In this repository I demonstrate how to put data science at the center of marketing 
and business decisions in a B-to-C insurance context.

The focus is not on isolated models, but on integrating funnel analytics, segmentation,
predictive modeling, attribution, and forecasting into actionable marketing strategy.

## Business Questions
1) Which marketing channels and geographies drive profitable insurance growth?
2) How do we balance lead volume with underwriting quality?
3) How should marketing spend be reallocated to improve expected lifetime value?

## Scope
The project will cover:
- Funnel conversion and geographic performance analysis
- Audience segmentation for targeting and personalization
- Predictive lead scoring and early-claim risk modeling
- Attribution and campaign lift considerations
- KPI forecasting and scenario planning

## Why This Matters
In insurance, growth without risk discipline destroys value.
This project shows how marketing analytics can drive sustainable, profitable growth.

## Roadmap
- Stage 1: Business framing, funnel metrics, geo analysis
- Stage 2: Segmentation and predictive models
- Stage 3: Attribution, lift, and forecasting
- Stage 4: Executive recommendations and dashboards
